# First Post

I decided to start a blog where I can write about topics that interest me. Right now, it's kind of minimal; I spent a bit of time setting up Github Pages/Jekyll so that I can just write text, push my changes and not care about anything else.

This is mostly a test post, and not an introduction. I have a few topics outlined that I wanted to write about for some time, and hopefully I will do so soon.
